    <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method.
         The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light,
         you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p><br>
    <H1>Ingredients</H1>
    <ul>
    <li>Uncooked spaghetti, 1 pound</li>
    <li>Olive oil, half cup</li>
    <li>Garlic, 6 cloves</li>
    <li>Red pepper flakes, quarter teaspoon</li>
    <li>Salt and ground pepper</li>
    <li>Quarter cup chopped Italian parsley</li>
    <li>1 cup parmigiano reggiano</li>
    </ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
<li>Gather all ingredients</li>
<li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
    Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. 
    Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl. </p></li>
<li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. </li>
<li><p>Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. 
    Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes.
     Remove from heat. </p></li>
<li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta.</li>
<li><p>Pour in hot olive oil and garlic,
     and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined. </p></li>
