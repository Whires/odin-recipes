    <p>Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,
     made in very wide, flat sheets. The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of
     lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.</p>
